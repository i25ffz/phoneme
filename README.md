##Introduce
phoneME for Windows CE/Mobile and Android is an implementation of the phoneME open source J2ME application platform for your Windows Mobile phone or Android handheld device. There are two different platforms of the phoneME virtual machine: phoneME Feature and phoneME Advanced.

Beyond precompiled binaries of these VMs for WinCE and Android based operating systems, this website provides information, patches and instructions in order to compile the phoneME sources yourself. 

More information about the phoneME project and these two types of virtual machines can be found at https://phoneme.dev.java.net.
